- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Normalize
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
  Lately, I've been using SASS to build the projects. I feel more comfortable with it. However, It gets a little bit messy and I learned that it's important to make things clear. To make readable lines not just for me, but for other people. Also, to organize yourself in order to be more productive.  


### Continued development

After a deep consideration, I decided to focus on Js for the rest of the projects I built. I have made several projects with just HTML and CSS and I think I have a pretty good level on making simple websites. I want to make a step further.
